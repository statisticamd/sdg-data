**Non-statistical indicator**

Education in the UK is devolved, and so there is some variance in the approach to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). We have therefore identified relevant policy/legislation by country, as well as the official curriculum and some supporting case
studies.

*England*

[National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum)

*Northern Ireland*

[Overview of the Northern Ireland Curriculum](http://ccea.org.uk/curriculum/overview)

*Scotland*

Excellence](http://www.gov.scot/resource/doc/226155/0061245.pdf) and [Learning for Sustainability (DOC 33 KB)](http://www.gov.scot/resource/0041/00416172.docx)

*Wales*

[Curriculum](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/improvementareas/curriculum/?lang=en), [Well-being of Future
Generations (Wales) Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/contents/enacted) (see Goal 4 in particular) and [Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/browse-all/education-for-sustainable-development-and-global-
citizenship/?lang=en)

A support document showing relevant ESD case studies can be found in [‘Good practice in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in the UK - Case Studies’ (PDF 165 KB)](https://www.unesco.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/UKNC-Case-Study-1-FINAL.pdf).

**Non-
statistical indicator**

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.
