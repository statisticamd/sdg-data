  It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only show the percent reaching national standards, not whether
  teachers in different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across countries. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify
  or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
